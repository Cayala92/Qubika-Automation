 * TODO:
 * The Landing Page Page Object encapsulates all interactions with elements 
 * on the landing page of the application. The goal is to make tests more 
 * maintainable and scalable by separating the page interactions from the test logic.
 * 
 * This file contains:
 * - Selectors for key elements of the landing page.
 * - Methods to interact with those elements (clicks, checks, etc.).
 * 
 * The Page Object pattern allows the same class to be reused across multiple 
 * tests without duplicating interaction code.
